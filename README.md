# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to clean, preprocess, and analyze key patterns. It leverages **Python, SQL and Pandas** to handle missing data, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for further insights. I request you to go through my repository thoroughly and also feel free to connect with me.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and incorrect data types.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts categorical variables into appropriate formats.
- **Basic Analysis**: Generates summary statistics and data visualizations.
- **Insights & Patterns**: Helps understand key trends in the dataset.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and SQL installed (preferably **Python 3.7+**). Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🚀 Usage

```Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/AditiVaidya10/eda-project.git
cd eda-project
```

```Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb
```
Update the file path in the script to match your dataset.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains transaction records with attributes such as:
 - TransactionDate: Date of transaction
 - CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers
 - PaymentMethod: Type of payment used
 - StoreType: Type of store where the purchase was made
 - IsPromotional: Whether the transaction was part of a promotion

🔍 Key Analysis Steps

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Convert data types for proper analysis.
Handle missing values by dropping or imputing them.
Generate summary statistics for numeric and categorical variables.
Visualize data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📈 Example Output

# Summary statistics
```
df.describe()
```
